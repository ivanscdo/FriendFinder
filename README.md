# FriendFinder

## Overview

`FriendFinder` is a compatibility-based application -- not unlike a dating app. This site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

It is a full-stack app built with `Express` to handle routing. It is hosted on `Heroku` so other users can fill it out. 

## Getting Started

1. Head on over to  [Heroku.com/]().

## Using the App

1. Make sure followed the instructions in the Getting Started section. 
2. Click on the `Questions` button.
3. Fill out the questions to the best of your knowledge - go with your gut!
