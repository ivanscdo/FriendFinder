# FriendFinder

## Overview

`FriendFinder` is a compatibility-based application, not unlike a dating app. This site will take in results from users' surveys - surveys which have been rigorously designed to ensure the perfect possible match - then compare their answers with those from other users. After running the responses through a set of specialized formulas, a propriety process we've coined as "magic hubabaloo", the app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. You will be guaranteed to have the best match $0 can buy.

## Tech Stack

`FriendFinder` is a full-stack app built with `Express` to handle routing, and it is hosted on `Heroku` so other users can fill it out.
